Using grep in Linux:

grep returns lines that contian a match for an input in certain files that are also inputted by the user.
For example, " grep hehehe * ", would return all places where the term "hehehe" exists from all of the existing files. 
In the example command "hehehe" signifies to search for the term "hehehe", and the "*" represents to search through all of the files. 

Another example would be " grep hahaha example.txt ", which would return all the lines where "hahaha" exists in the file example.txt.

The grep command can be useful as an alternative to a "ctrl-f" of sorts, or to find which file contains a specific command.
