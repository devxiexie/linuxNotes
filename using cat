cat's main use is to print the content of a file into the output stream.
For example, if hehe.txt only contained the lines "hehehoho", and the command "cat hehe.txt" was issued, the line "hehehoho" would be returned.

There are also other variations of using the cat command.

One use is "cat file1 file2" would show the contents of both file1 and file2.

Another use is "cat -n file", in which the content with the line number will be shown. 
So, if one were to enter "cat -n example.txt", then the result would be:
1)hello!
2)This is an example!
3)very nice!

Another useful application of the cat command is "cat > newfile", in which a new file called "newfile" will be created. 

A fun use of the cat command is the tac command, in which the displayed content will be in reversed order.

There are many other uses for the cat command too!
